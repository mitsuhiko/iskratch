iSkratch
========

iSkratch is an application inspired by Scratch for HTML5 devices.  It is
based on jQTouch, jQuery and Classy (thus a JavaScript application) and is
in the current (and final) form the third implementation.

The user interface is not fully stable and there are a few issues with the
runtime as well, the concept however is quite solid despite being
developed in about 20 hours.

The code you see here is what we finally delivered for a task that was
given to us at the University of Technology and might be useful for you if
you want to develop interpreters/compilers in JavaScript with Scratch like
semantics.

The most interesting part is probably still the original prototoype that
is written in Python and generates a JavaScript file from an AST tree.

Another thing: last minute things were translated to German and I did not
yet revert these changes (and quite frankly I doubt I ever will) and I got
rid of the useless unittests.
